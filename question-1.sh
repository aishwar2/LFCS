# As the Linux system administration of ABC Company you have been getting complaints about the performance of some of the Linux servers used by your development team. 
# After investigating the source of these performance issue you realize the number of running processes started by users is too high.
#
# 1. Set a limit on the number of processes users of the 'developer' group can start.  
# 2. Ensure that user 'Bob' who is a member of the 'developer' group is not impacted by these limits.
